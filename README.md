# TwitterPhoneScout

A web app that searches from a base Twitter handle and grabs followers who post phone numbers in their bios.
It runs the phone numbers it finds through Twilio to gather metadata about the numbers - specifically looking for voip numbers.  

# The original goal of this project was to find small businesses using voip to interface with customers
